The tutorials are saved as a package that can also be installed and run locally in RStudio.


## Getting started

1. Install the package from GitHub from the R console.

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("afrimapr/afrilearnr")
```

2. Load the package

```{r load}
library(afrilearnr)
```

3. In RStudio Click on the *Tutorial* tab at the top right, choose an afrilearnr tutorial, and click *Start Tutorial ?*

Alternatively you can start a tutorial by name from the R console :     

```{r runtutorial, eval=FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("join-admin", "afrilearnr")
```
