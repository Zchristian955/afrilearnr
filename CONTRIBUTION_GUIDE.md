## learnr tips

1. headers indicated with '##' become separate sections and appear in index on left


## hazards

1. exercise chunks plotting interactive maps (with tmap or mapview) need to have unique ids set like this :
```{r tmap-points1-setup}
# to avoid issues with interactive maps https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/issues/529
# IdSeed must be set to be unique in the Rmd, even for mode('plot') to allow user to change
tmap_mode("plot")
htmlwidgets::setWidgetIdSeed(1)
```

The solution is to re-set the projection:
st_crs(data) <- 4326
